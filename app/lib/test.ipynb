Given the rapid advancement of Machine Learning (ML) models, the concept of AGI has passed from being the subject of philosophical debate to one with near-term practical relevance. Some experts believe that \"sparks\" of AGI (Bubeck et al., 2023) are already present in the latest generation of large language models (LLMs); some predict AI will broadly outperform humans within about a decade (Bengio et al., 2023); some even assert that current LLMs are AGIs (Agüera y Arcas and Norvig, 2023). However, if you were to ask 100 AI experts to define what they mean by \"AGI,\" you would likely get 100 related but different definitions.The concept of AGI is important as it maps onto goals for, predictions about, and risks of AI: Goals: Achieving human-level \"intelligence\" is an implicit or explicit north-star goal for many in our field, from the 1955 Dartmouth AI Conference (McCarthy et al., 1955) that kick-started the', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

In this section, we consider nine prominent examples, and reflect on their strengths and limitations. This analysis informs our subsequent introduction of a two-dimensional, leveled ontology of AGI.Case Study 1: The Turing Test. The Turing Test (Turing, 1950) is perhaps the most well-known attempt to operationalize an AGI-like concept. Turing\\'s \"imitation game\" was posited as a way to operationalize the question of whether machines could think, and asks a human to interactively distinguish whether text is produced by another human or by a machine. The test as originally framed is a thought experiment, and is the subject of many critiques (Wikipedia, 2023b); in practice, the test often highlights the ease of fooling people (Weizenbaum, 1966;Wikipedia, 2023a) rather than the \"intelligence\" of the machine. Given that modern LLMs pass some framings of the Turing Test, it seems clear that this criteria is insufficient for operationalizing or benchmarking AGI. We agree with Turing that whether a machine can \"think,\" while an interesting philosophical and scientific question, seems orthogonal to the question of what the machine can do; the latter is much more straightforward to measure and more important for evaluating impacts. Therefore we propose that AGI should be defined in terms of capabilities rather than processes2 .Case Study 2: Strong AI -Systems Possessing Consciousness. Philosopher John Searle mused, \"according to strong AI, the computer is not merely a tool in the study of the mind; rather, the appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states\" (Searle, 1980). While strong AI might be one path to achieving AGI, there is no scientific consensus on methods for determining whether machines possess strong AI attributes such as consciousness (Butlin et al., 2023), making the process-oriented focus of this framing impractical.Case Study 3: Analogies to the Human Brain. The original use of the term \"artificial general intelligence\" was in a 1997 article about military technologies by Mark Gubrud (Gubrud, 1997), which defined AGI as \"AI systems that rival or surpass the human brain in complexity and speed, that can acquire, manipulate and reason with general knowledge, and that are usable in essentially any phase of industrial or military operations where a human intelligence would otherwise be needed.\" This early definition emphasizes processes (rivaling the human brain in complexity) in addition to capabilities; while neural network architectures underlying modern ML systems are loosely inspired by the human brain, the success of transformer-based architectures (Vaswani et al., 2023) whose performance is not reliant on human-like learning suggests that strict brain-based processes and benchmarks are not inherently necessary for AGI.Case Study 4: Human-Level Performance on Cognitive Tasks. Legg (Legg, 2008) and Goertzel (Goertzel, 2014) popularized the term AGI among computer scientists in 2001 (Legg, 2022), describing AGI as a machine that is able to do the cognitive tasks that people can typically do. This definition notably focuses on non-physical tasks (i.e., not requiring robotic embodiment as a precursor to AGI). Like many other definitions of AGI, this framing presents ambiguity around choices such as \"what tasks?\" and \"which people?\".Case Study 5: Ability to Learn Tasks. In The Technological Singularity (Shanahan, 2015), Shanahan suggests that AGI is \"Artificial intelligence that is not specialized to carry out specific tasks, but can learn to perform as broad a range of tasks as a human.\" An important property of this framing is its emphasis on the value of including metacognitive tasks (learning) among the requirements for achieving AGI.Case Study 6: Economically Valuable Work. OpenAI\\'s charter defines AGI as \"highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work\" (OpenAI, 2018). This definition has strengths per the \"capabilities, not processes\" criteria, as it focuses on performance agnostic to underlying mechanisms; further, this definition offers a potential yardstick for measurement, i.e., economic value. A shortcoming of this definition is that it does not capture all of the criteria that may be part of \"general intelligence.\" There are many tasks that are associated with intelligence that may not have a well-defined economic value (e.g., artistic creativity or emotional intelligence). Such properties may be indirectly accounted for in economic measures (e.g., artistic creativity might produce books or movies, emotional intelligence might relate to the ability to be a successful CEO), though whether economic value captures the full spectrum of \"intelligence\" remains unclear. Another challenge with a framing of AGI in terms of economic value is that this implies a need for deployment of AGI in order to realize that value, whereas a focus on capabilities might only require the potential for an AGI to execute a task. We may well have systems that are technically capable of performing economically important tasks but don\\'t realize that economic value for varied reasons (legal, ethical, social, etc.).Case Study 7: Flexible and General -The \"Coffee Test\" and Related Challenges. Marcus suggests that AGI is \"shorthand for any intelligence (there might be many) that is flexible and general, with resourcefulness and reliability comparable to (or beyond) human intelligence\" (Marcus, 2022b). This definition captures both generality and performance (via the inclusion of reliability); the mention of \"flexibility\" is noteworthy, since, like the Shanahan formulation, this suggests that metacognitive tasks such as the ability to learn new skills must be included in an AGI\\'s set of capabilities in order to achieve sufficient generality. Further, Marcus operationalizes his definition by proposing five concrete tasks (understanding a movie, understanding a novel, cooking in an arbitrary kitchen, writing a bug-free 10,000 line program, and converting natural language mathematical proofs into symbolic form) (Marcus, 2022a). Accompanying a definition with a benchmark is valuable; however, more work would be required to construct a sufficiently comprehensive benchmark. While we agree that failing some of these tasks indicates a system is not an AGI, it is unclear that passing them is sufficient for AGI status. In the Testing for AGI section, we further discuss the challenge in developing a set of tasks that is both necessary and sufficient for capturing the generality of AGI. We also note that one of Marcus\\' proposed tasks, \"work as a competent cook in an arbitrary kitchen\" (a variant of Steve Wozniak\\'s \"Coffee Test\" (Wozniak, 2010)), requires robotic embodiment; this differs from other definitions that focus on non-physical tasks3 .Case Study 8: Artificial Capable Intelligence. In The Coming Wave, Suleyman proposed the concept of \"Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI)\" (Mustafa Suleyman and Michael Bhaskar, 2023) to refer to AI systems with sufficient performance and generality to accomplish complex, multi-step tasks in the open world. More specifically, Suleyman proposed an economically-based definition of ACI skill that he dubbed the \"Modern Turing Test,\" in which an AI would be given $100,000 of capital and tasked with turning that into $1,000,000 over a period of several months. This framing is more narrow than OpenAI\\'s definition of economically valuable work and has the additional downside of potentially introducing alignment risks (Kenton et al., 2021) by only targeting fiscal profit. However, a strength of Suleyman\\'s concept is the focus on performing a complex, multi-step task that humans value. Construed more broadly than making a million dollars, ACI\\'s emphasis on complex, real-world tasks is noteworthy, since such tasks may have more ecological validity than many current AI benchmarks; Marcus\\' aforementioned five tests of flexibility and generality (Marcus, 2022a) seem within the spirit of ACI, as well.Case Study 9: SOTA LLMs as Generalists. Agüera y Arcas and Norvig (Agüera y Arcas and Norvig, 2023) suggested that state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g. mid-2023 deployments of GPT-4, Bard, Llama 2, and Claude) already are AGIs, arguing that generality is the key property of AGI, and that because language models can discuss a wide range of topics, execute a wide range of tasks, handle multimodal inputs and outputs, operate in multiple languages, and \"learn\" from zero-shot or few-shot examples, they have achieved sufficient generality. While we agree that generality is a crucial characteristic of AGI, we posit that it must also be paired with a measure of performance (i.e., if an LLM can write code or perform math, but is not reliably correct, then its generality is not yet sufficiently performant).', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We argue that any definition of AGI should meet the following six criteria:1. Focus on Capabilities, not Processes. The majority of definitions focus on what an AGI can accomplish, not on the mechanism by which it accomplishes tasks. This is important for identifying characteristics that are not necessarily a prerequisite for achieving AGI (but may nonetheless be interesting research topics). This focus on capabilities allows us to exclude the following from our requirements for AGI:• Achieving AGI does not imply that systems think or understand in a human-like way (since this focuses on processes, not capabilities)• Achieving AGI does not imply that systems possess qualities such as consciousness (subjective awareness) (Butlin et al., 2023) or sentience (the ability to have feelings) (since these qualities not only have a process focus, but are not currently measurable by agreed-upon scientific methods)2. Focus on Generality and Performance. All of the above definitions emphasize generality to varying degrees, but some exclude performance criteria. We argue that both generality and performance are key components of AGI.
